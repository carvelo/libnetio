			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p class="text-justify">
				libnetio aims to be a library specializing in networking I/O to provide quick asynchronous 
				throughput with minimal memory requirements. Currently, libnetio targets Microsoft Windows, 
				Mac OS X and Linux operating systems. 
				<br><br>
				Different operating systems implement different APIs to provide asynchronous networking 
				models, with Windows using IOCP(Input/Output Completion Port), Mac OS X using kqueue and 
				Linux using epoll. It is libnetio's job to make use of these APIs in the respective platforms
				and provide an common interface that will output the same results across different operating systems.

			<h1>IOCP in Microsoft Windows</h1>
			<p class="text-justify">
				IOCP, which stands for Input/Output Completion Port, is Microsoft's API for performing multiple
				asynchronous operations. 
				<br><br>
				The way IOCP works is quite simple. You fire a request, say WSARecv(), and your application will 
				be notified after completing a receive. In this context, completion means receiving data and storing the
				data in a specified buffer. When IOCP notifies the application WSARecv() has been completed, the application
				will already have the data in the buffer; the application just needs to process the data now.
				<br><br>
				This is different from similar APIs, where the application is notified when there is data to be received and
				the application must explicitly call recv() to handle it. In IOCP, the application is not notified when there 
				is data to be received; it is only notified when the data has already been received. This means that there is
				no explicit recv() call being made.
				<br><br>
				<br><br>
				The first step toward implementing IOCP with network sockets is to create an IOCP. This is done with the
				<b>CreateIoCompletionPort</b> function.
